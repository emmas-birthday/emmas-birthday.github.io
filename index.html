        Hi Emma! Happy birthday! You are such an enthusiastic person to be
        around and are a great friend. And seriously one day you have to be my
        interior designer because your apartment always looked ready for a photo
        shoot! I hope you have an amazing birthday filled with lots of good
        food, drinks, and friends!
