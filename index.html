        I know that turning 21 during quarantine is not the best. Believe me, I
        know first hand lmao. I just wanted to let you know that the past 3
        years have been a wild ride. Many pregames, many drunken rants about
        people that pissed you off and even more memories of board game nights,
        movie nights, study sessions. Thank you Emma for being one of the best
        people I have ever met, college definitely would not have been the same
        without you. Heres to 21, drink a lot and drink often!

        I hope that this collection of memories can help ease the pain :). Here
        are some pictures that I found on my camera roll that I think you will
        enjoy now that you can ~legally~ get drunk. -Jack

        Hi Emma! Happy birthday! You are such an enthusiastic person to be
        around and are a great friend. And seriously one day you have to be my
        interior designer because your apartment always looked ready for a photo
        shoot! I hope you have an amazing birthday filled with lots of good
        food, drinks, and friends!

        21. LIKE HELLO! I can‚Äôt believe we are all not out together and not

        survived all aspects of life without you for so long, but I am so
        honored now to have you in my life and call you one of my closest

        Happy birthday! I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better, more creative friend for
        the past three years. You are one of the hardest workers i know and
        somehow still find the time to make our apartment such a cozy home and
        have time for all of our roomie shenanigans. I love you sm and can‚Äôt
        wait until we are back on campus together again!!

        EMMAAAA, happy happy happy birthday you beautiful soul! I hope you have
        the best quarantine birthday and I hope you get dumb lit hehe... but

        and banana breading making, seeing you makes me so so happy and I can‚Äôt
        wait to squeeeeze you when all of this is close to over... happy
        birthday you crazy gal and never change! ü•∞üòòüòç
